    """
    When generating ephemeris, orbits need to be backwards propagated to the time
    at which the light emitted or relflected from the object towards the observer.

    Light time correction must be added to orbits in expressed in an inertial frame (ie, orbits
    must be barycentric)

    Parameters
    ----------
    orbits : `~numpy.ndarray` (N, 6)
        Barycentric orbits in cartesian elements to correct for light time delay.
    t0 : `~numpy.ndarray` (N)
        Epoch at which orbits are defined.
    observer_positions : `numpy.ndarray` (N, 3)
        Location of the observer in barycentric cartesian elements at the time of observation.
    lt_tol : float, optional
        Calculate aberration to within this value in time (units of days.)
    mu : float, optional
        Gravitational parameter (GM) of the attracting body in units of
        AU**3 / d**2.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations over which to converge for propagation.
    tol : float, optional
        Numerical tolerance to which to compute universal anomaly during propagation using the Newtown-Raphson
        method.

        Orbits adjusted for light travel time.

    The motion of the observer in an inertial frame will cause an object
