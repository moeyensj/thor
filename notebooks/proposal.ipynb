    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation of the LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) requires the LSST cadence to deliver at least two visits a night to a single field. Two visits to a single field allows for the creation of tracklets: sky-plane motion vectors in the reference frame of the observer that constrain the direction and velocity of a potential moving object. A minimum of three pairs of visits (three tracklets) taken in a ~two week period are necessary for LSST to deliver its Solar System science data products. Objects that do not follow this pattern will not be successfully linked (e.g., as a particularly bad example, an object with 14 observations over 14 nights, yet with no pairs in a single night, will not be linked).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be useful to improve on the existing MOPS algorithm for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jones et al. (2017) show that there are NEOs that are observed in the LSST baseline observing strategy that are not detected by tracklet-based MOPS. Yet these have _sufficient observations_ to solve for the orbit _if one were able to link them_. Having an algorithm not strongly constrained by cadence could potentially increase the NEO yields by 5 to 10 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having two visits a night (and in a $\\lesssim 60$ minute interval) is not generally required by the other three science drivers. Doing away with this requirement would liberate the cadence optimization process, potentially increasing science yields in other areas.\n"

    "#### The Algorithm: Shift-and-Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Linking the observations together means identifying point source or trailed detections recorded at various times as being the observations of the same object moving through the Solar System on an (approximately) heliocentric orbit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is challenging for a few reasons:\n",
    "* There are many objects moving on similar trajectories, and given a set of observations taken at arbitrary times it is not obvious which asteroid from (say) the image A corresponds to which from image B, etc. Note that this becomes possible if the objects are observed in quick succession (so they move less than the typical on-sky distance between two asteroids); this leads to the existing tracklet algorithm which we're trying to improve on.\n",
    "* The situation is further confused by _false positive detections_ -- artefacts that masquerade as observations, yet arise due to instrumental issues, software impefections, or even photon noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one _knew_ the exact orbit of an object, the linkage would be relatively trivial: simply compute the predicted location of the object and any detections found at those predicted positons are very likely to be the observations of the object at hand. However, as we don't know the exact orbit, this insight does not appear to be of much practical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let us look at this from a different perspective. Given a known orbit, we can also link the observations by computing and undoing the _shifts_ (e.g., $\\Delta \\alpha$, $\\Delta \\delta$) of second and subsequent observation relative to the first one. This will _shift back_ all observation to the coordinate frame of the first one, forming a _cluster_ of observations (dispersed only by the observational error) at the location of the initial observation. We can then detect this cluster, and link the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking along these lines leads us to a proposal for a potential cadence independent asteroid linking scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first key insight is that, if we allow for the cluster to be broader than the observational error and not exactly at the location of the first observation, it's not necessary to know the _exact_ orbit: a _guess_ (a _test orbit_) will be sufficient to _cluster_ together observations of all asteroids in a bundle of orbits around it. Shifting back the observations of objects on nearby orbits will form clusters of detections detectable above the background of false positives and observations of objects not close to the test orbit. This still leaves a computationally formidable task of densly covering the 4D manifold of allowed orbits (for every small region of the sky) with a sufficient number of test orbits to tease out all possible linkages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second insight is that the shift-and-cluster operation should not be performed in geo- (or topo-) centric frame, but in the _heliocentric_ frame. Viewed from the Sun, observations of an object form a great circle. The motion of one object relative to another on an adjacent orbits will (approximately) form an ellipse over the orbital period $T_{\\rm orb}$. (n.b.: note some analogy with the guiding center approximation of Galactic dynamics; also with Bernstein's treatment of KBOs). More importantly, over time spans $T << T_{\\rm orb}$, the relative motion _will be linear_. Therefore, if we perform the shift in the heliocentric frame, the clusters be spread along _lines_ in (heliocentric) $(l, b, T_{\\rm obs})$ ecliptic coordinates. This _linear structure_ allows us to detect the clusters even when they'd be too diluted for detection by a simple density-of-points criterion, thus reducing the number of test orbits needed to exhaustively cover the 4D manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is similar in many ways to the well known shift-and-stack methods applied at a pixel level to search for extremely faint KBOs. In analogy with shift-and-stack, we term this general idea 'shift-and-cluster'.\n",

    "#### Proposed approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand the information we have at our disposal for a single observation (detection): it will at the very least provide us with information as to the location of the detection, the time, the magnitude (in a specific filter), and the associated signal to noise ratio. \n",

    "\n",
    "where we assume the reference axes are tied to J2000-Epoch ecliptic coordinate system. In this case, we know all three coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to try to link any DIASource detections using shift-and-cluster we need to make a guess for ($\\Delta, \\dot \\Delta$, $\\dot \\alpha$, $\\dot \\delta$) and shift any observations along the test orbit. Instead of the range to the observer, it is better to instead use the heliocentric distance, $r$. This is a simple change of variables, but it has the benefit that the range of plausible $\\dot r$ is much smaller than the range of plausible $\\dot \\Delta$ (e.g., $\\dot \\Delta$ reaches velocities similar to orbital velocities, while $\\dot r$ is typically much smaller). In fact, a guess of $\\dot \\Delta = 0$ may be sufficient to recover many objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we assume some reasonable heliocentric distance we can transform equatorial coordinates $(\\alpha_i, \\delta_i)$ to cartesian coordinates $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$, as well as their derivatives. From there we can perform a procedure similar to the work of Bernstein & Khushalani and transform to tangent plane coordinates from the reference point of the Sun. These tangent plane coordinates take the form $(\\theta_x, \\theta_y)$. So the coordinates in which we sample the 4D space of orbits are $(r, \\dot r, \\dot \\theta_x, \\dot \\theta_y)$ and we can start by assuming $\\dot r = 0$.\n",
