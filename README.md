Or, if preferred, installed into its own environment via:  
```conda create -n thor_py38 -c moeyensj thor python=3.8```

### Docker

A Docker container with the latest version of the code can be pulled using:  

```docker pull moeyensj/thor:latest```

To run the container:  

```docker run -it moeyensj/thor:latest```

The THOR code is installed the /projects directory, and is by default also installed in the container's Python installation.

```conda create -n thor_py38 -c defaults -c conda-forge -c astropy -c moeyensj --file requirements.txt python=3.8```  

Or, to install THOR in a pre-existing `conda` environment called `env`:  

```conda activate env```  
```conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge -c astropy -c moeyensj --file requirements.txt```  

Once pre-requisites have been installed using either one of the options above, then:
